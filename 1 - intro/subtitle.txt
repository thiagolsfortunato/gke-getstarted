Welcome to getting started with Kubernetes and Google Container Engine. My name's Jim Rambo and I'm one of the curriculum developers. This course is built by developers for those who want to learn how to develop containerized applications using Container Engine. There are four modules with hands-on labs. The first course module explains how applications used to be built and how they're built today. It introduces you to containers which are modeled after shipping containers to transport goods from ships to trains to trucks, with little or no care of what's inside or what infrastructure they're riding on. Similarly, software containers enable you to break up your application into modules and roll them out from development to staging to production, with little or no care for what's inside or what infrastructure they're deployed on. The second and third modules introduce you to Kubernetes, which is a container orchestration system for managing how containers run on machine clusters. You specify how many machines and containers you want running, how to use disks networking, and how to make sure they're working and Kubernetes does the rest. This allows you to manage large scale deployments. The last module walks you through an example of how to set up continuous delivery pipeline for coding from development, staging, to production. As you'll see, these tools simplify the role of developers, but they also enhance their operational responsibilities as they handle more end-to-end production. The goal is to get you started building applications using Kubernetes and Container Engine. It helps you to stay at a high level, but it allows you to get down into lower levels of the networking and disk where you need to. I hope you enjoy the course.
